Overview
********

**OAK-SoM-Max** has on-board :ref:`RVC3`, which has **much greater AI performance**
compared to :ref:`RVC2`, and **quadcore ARM CPU**. The OAK-SoM-Max is a System on Module (SoM) designed for integration into top-level systems with
a need for a low power, high performance, real-time AI, and depth perception.

The OAK-SoM-Max interfaces with the system through three 10-Gbps-rated 100-pin board-to-board mezzanine connector which
carries all signal I/O as well as 5v input. The on-board SMPS system regulates the 5V input and provides all necessary
digital and analog power.

Devices that use OAK-SoM-Max
****************************

All devices that have SoM on-board are also open-source. If you are interested in integrating DepthAI (via SoM)
into your product, see :ref:`documentation here <integrating_depthai_into_products>`.
