Overview
********

**OAK-SoM-Pro-S3** has on-board :ref:`Keem Bay VPU <OAK Series 3>`, which has **much greater AI performance** compared to Myriad X,
and **quadcore ARM CPU**. It was designed to have the same dimensions and pintout as the :ref:`OAK-SoM-Pro`, so it can easily
replace the :ref:`OAK-SoM-Pro` on OAK cameras that use it (:ref:`list here <Devices that use OAK-SoM-Pro>`).

It was primarily designed for evaluation and backwards compatibility.
For new products, we would suggest using :ref:`OAK-SoM-Max` (differences :ref:`here <OAK-SoM-Pro-KB vs OAK-SoM-Max>`).

The OAK-SoM-Pro-S3 is a System on Module (SoM) designed for integration into top-level system with
a need for a low-power, high performance, real-time AI and depth perception.

The OAK-SoM-Pro-S3 interfaces with the system through two 10-Gbps-rated 100-pin board-to-board mezzanine connector which
carries all signal I/O as well as 5v input. The on-board SMPS system regulates the 5V input and provides all necessary
digital and analog power. An auxiliary power port is offered to interface without connection to a baseboard.
